# Graphics Projects
#### A collection of comnputer graphics projects
##### I have always been very interested in computer graphics and depictions of visual mathematics.
##### In fact the mystries of geometry triggered my interest in mathematics and remains my favourite field of maths.
##### The combination of maths and art is a passion I wish to persue, given enough time I hope to fill this repository with examples of my work.
