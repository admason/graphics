# **Graphics Projects**
#### A collection of comnputer graphics projects
##### I have always been very interested in computer graphics and depictions of visual mathematics.
##### In fact the mystries of geometry triggered my interest in mathematics and remains my favourite field of maths.
##### The combination of maths and art is a passion I wish to persue, given enough time I hope to fill this repository with examples of my work.
## **1. Flowers.**
### Built on Python 3, jupyter notebook
#### flowers_1.ipynb
#### flowers_1.py


### **Build Status:** Working model, under development

#### This code uses the turtle module in order to draw geometric flowers.
#### The technique involves arclength measurements and the polyline function.
#### The user may choose the radius of the flower and the number of petals present via user inputs. Under the condition that there an ODD number of petals is selected. (This is due to undergo changes in further models to include even petals.)
#### For example, setting Radius=50 and Nuber of Petals=3, produces:
